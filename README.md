# My bashrc
Repository to keep my .bashrc

- `fullpull`: run git pull recursive on all run folder repositories
- `pdf $f`: open a pdf file `f`
- `countdown $x`: countdown with `x` seconds
- `contime $x`: countdown with `x` seconds and trigger a notification

Requirement used (Arch):
- `notify-send 0.7.9` (contime)
- `git` (fullpull, you don't expect to run git pull without git, right?)
